# Changelog

All notable changes to payflow-frontend. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **The publish form accepted any text as a price** and only failed once the
  transaction was simulated, so a merchant paid for a failed attempt. The
  price is validated inline — positive, at most 7 decimal places — and Publish
  stays disabled with a message until it is usable.

### Added

- **Fee split preview on the publish form.** "Subscriber pays X · protocol fee Y
  (Z%) · you receive W", read live from the contract's `fee_bps` and computed in
  bigint exactly as `charge` does. If the rate cannot be read the form still
  works and previews a 0% split.
- **Upcoming charges calendar.** The account page can download an `.ics` file
  containing the next charge of every active mandate, with a recurrence bounded
  by the mandate's charge cap. Works in contract-only mode because the file is
  generated in the browser from the mandates already on screen.
- **Copy buttons for addresses and transaction hashes.** Both copy the full
  value rather than the shortened text, with the result announced through a
  live region.
- **Mobile navigation menu.** Below the `md` breakpoint the header links
  collapse into a menu button with `aria-expanded`, Escape-to-close and focus
  management.
- **Skeleton loading states** for plan cards, mandate rows and dashboard stats.
  The pulse is disabled when the user prefers reduced motion.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-09

Points at the v0.2.0 contract suite on testnet.

### Fixed

- **The demo misread every mandate's status.** Contract state decodes a
  `MandateStatus` as `["Active"]`, not `"Active"`, so on the contract-only path
  (the public demo, which has no backend) every `status === "Active"` check was
  false. "Charge now" never appeared, the merchant's active count was 0, and
  Pause sent a resume, which the contract rejected.
- **A failed charge blamed the wrong person.** When the subscriber's vault
  could not cover a charge, the vault's error #4 reached the page through
  `charge` and was shown as "You are not the subscriber on this mandate". It
  now says the vault does not hold enough. A missing plan during `subscribe`
  is reported as such instead of "That subscription does not exist".
- Wallet context hook dependencies: `signXdr` is now part of the memoised
  context value, and a stale dependency on a module function is gone.
- `npm run lint` could not run (Next's `next lint` with no ESLint config). It
  now runs ESLint 9 with `eslint-config-next`, and CI enforces it.

### Added

- Merchants can end a subscriber's mandate from the dashboard, with a second
  click to confirm because it is permanent. Subscribers see when a merchant
  ended a mandate.
- The contract-only fallback reads the paged indexes from the v0.2.0
  contracts and lists the newest plans using `next_plan_id`, instead of
  probing ids 1 to 24.
- The Pages build reads the backend URL from the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
  repository variable, so connecting a deployed backend needs no code change.

### Changed

- `@stellar/stellar-sdk` 13 → 17, for testnet's current protocol.
- 50 → 60 tests.
